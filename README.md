# 3340-Voltage-Controlled-Oscillator-Module
CEM3340 voltage controlled oscillator module for eurorack synthesizers.
The CEM3340 is a legendary voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) integrated circuit developed by Curtis Electromusic Specialties in the late 1970s. It has been widely used in classic analog synthesizers, including the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 (starting from Rev.3), Roland Jupiter-6, Roland SH101, Moog Memorymoog and others.

Since 2016, the chip has been reissued, making it available to Companies developing musical instruments, but also to DIY enthusiasts and synth designers (Yaiii! :)).

This "VCO in a package" offers several features that make it a powerful choice for analog synthesizer designs:

- Multiple, independent waveform outputs (sawtooth, triangle, and square/pulse waves)

- Exponential and linear frequency voltage control

- Built-in frequency temperature compensation

- Hard and soft waveform phase sync

- Small footprint

- Great analog sound!

There are plenty of very nice projects and general articles on this IC out there to take inspiration from, but I wanted to build mine keeping some constrains in mind:

- The module had to be as small as possible (I am targeting polyphony)

- Full eurorack compatibility

- Easy to build

- Use of common and cheap components

# About This Repository
This repository hosts two versions of my CEM3340 module. Version 2 is the most up-to-date: it's smaller and more in-line with eurorack standards. Version 1 is still there for reference only.
